# IV Skew Trading Strategy

This project investigates whether VIX term‑structure & skew strategy can predict future stock returns. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, portfolio construction, backtesting, and performance evaluation. Back‑tested a trading strategy that exploits S&P 500 implied‑volatility term structure (VIX vs VIX‑3M) and tail‑risk skew (CBOE SKEW) to forecast SPY returns.
